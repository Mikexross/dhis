                <p>Jerry is thorough and honest. He takes the time to explain and review all information. Great Job
                    Jerry! </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Thoroughness of the inspection was impressive and very well done. It felt like Jerry Ross was doing
                    this inspection for himself.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Your job! Finding the things that we wouldâ€™ve never noticed!! When we go invest in our home, we want
                    the best for our money!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Found many issues, defined what they were and what should be done to remedy. Also included pictures
                    which were very helpful.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Very knowledgeable, thorough and an all round nice and trustworthy person.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Quick response time, very thorough, took time to review all the results with us.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Great attitude, very thorough and readily available for questions and communication.
                </p>

                <p>Home Inspector provided preliminary description of what he was going to be looking at and then
                    proceeded to thoroughly inspect my home from top to bottom, inside and out. Once he completed his
                    inspection, he took the time to explain his findings and offered guidance with regard to things that
                    builder needs to address. It was VERY helpful.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Explained everything in detail. We appreciated the time Jerry took to break things down since we
                    were first time home buyers.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Everything. Unbelievably thorough. Great communication and explanation of concerns with home. The
                    value and quality of your inspection was worth more than what I paid.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p> Great report that explains everything so well and photo quality is excellent as well!
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>Very thorough and detailed report. Best part was the call with Jerry to discuss the report. This
                    allowed for me to simply not read words but to get a "feel" for what was found (good as well as
                    bad)...there is a lot of interpretation lost when simply reading a document.
